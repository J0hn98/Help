2. Go into a computer folder where you want to keep track of git projects

3. clone repository (link) (name of local repository)

5. Add a new file using touch (file name . file type)

6. Create a new file with vim (file name. file type). Write the file, then press :wq to exit...

7. Type git add (file name.file type). This says that you want to ready the changes in this document to the github repo.

8. Type git status. This tells the local repo that I want to prepare the changes I made in the original document ready for being uploaded to the github repo

9. Type git commit -m "Explanation of changes from previous version"

10. type git push origin master (file name. file type). This uploads the file to github!
